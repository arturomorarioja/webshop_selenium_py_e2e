# KEA Webshop End-to-End Test

## Purpose
Example of Selenium Webdriver end-to-end tests on the [KEA Webshop](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_webshop). The test is coded in Python and uses Firefox's Gecko driver.

## Instructions
1. The webshop is expected to run at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`. This value can be changed in `test.py`.
2. Activate Python's virtual environment and install Selenium and the Gecko driver for Firefox. In Windows:
```

```
3. Run the tests:
```
